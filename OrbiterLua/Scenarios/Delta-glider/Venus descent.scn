BEGIN_DESC
You are descending into the thick atmosphere of Venus.

If you have selected the complex flight model, then the high atmospheric pressure at lower altitudes will render your engines ineffective,
and below an altitude of about 40km they will stop producing thrust altogether.
So if you want to keep airborne, you need to stabilise your orbit soon.
