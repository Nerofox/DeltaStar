BEGIN_DESC
The attitude of an object can be stabilised by spinning it rapidly around
one of its axes of symmetry.
In this scenario, two rockets are placed in a low orbit. One is spinning
around its axis at 1Hz, the other is not. The spinning rocket maintains its
global orientation, while the other starts to rotate under the influence
of gravity gradient torque.

Speed up to 100x and watch the behaviour of both rockets.

Try killing the angular velocity of the spinning rocket (using the Scenario
Editor) and see what happens.

This scenario requires gravity gradient torque enabled in the "Parameters" tab
of the Orbiter Launchpad.
