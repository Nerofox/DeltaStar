A geostationary orbit is a circular orbit above Earth's equator (inclination 0
degrees) whose orbital period is equal to the length of a siderial day (23 hours,
56 minutes and 4 seconds). This corresponds to a semi-major axis of about
42160 km. A satellite placed in such an orbit remains stationary above the same
point on the equator, which is quite useful for many applications, such as
communication satellites.


In this scenario, a glider is placed in a geostationary orbit above Africa's east
coast. Note that the vessel indicator in the Map MFD does not move. Try opening
a surface MFD and check the ground speed readout.
