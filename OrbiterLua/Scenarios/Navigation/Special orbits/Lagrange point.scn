Lagrange points are equilibrium points in the gravitational potential field
generated by a two-body system. Two of these points (called "L4" and "L5")
are stable if the orbits are circular and field perturbations can be neglected.

That means, a spacecraft "parked" in one of these points (with the correct initial
velocity) retains its relative position to the two bodies indefinitely. In real
life, the craft would have to make regular course corrections to avoid being
ejected from the Lagrange point.

In this scenario, a Delta-glider is placed in the L4 point of the Earth-Moon
system. It is orbiting Earth 60 degrees ahead of the Moon. Without correction
burns, the glider will be ejected after a while.
