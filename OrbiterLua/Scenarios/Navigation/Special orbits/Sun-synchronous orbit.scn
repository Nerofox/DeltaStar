A sun-synchronous orbit is a near-polar orbit with an inclination of slightly
more than 90 degrees. At this inclination, the line of nodes moves at a rate
of 360 degrees per year (nearly 1 degree per day), due to the nonspherical
distortion of Earth's gravitational field. Thus, the orbital plane
retains its relative orientation with respect to the sun.


In this example, the orbit is set up to continuously move along the Earth's terminator.


Note: You must activate "nonspherical gravity sources" in the Launchpad for this scenario to work!
