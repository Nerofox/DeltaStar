The Hubble Space Telescope is the visible/ultraviolet/near-infrared
element of the Great Observatories astronomical program. The spacecraft
provides an order of magnitude better resolution than is capable from
ground-based telescopes.


During initial on-orbit checkout of the Hubble's systems, a
flaw in the telescope's main reflective mirror was found that prevented
perfect focus of the incoming light. This flaw was caused by the
incorrect adjustment of a testing device used in building the mirror.
Fortunately, however, Hubble was designed for regular on-orbit
maintenance by Shuttle missions. The first servicing mission, STS-61 in
December 1993, fully corrected the problem by installing a corrective
optics package and upgraded instruments (as well as replacing other
satellite components). 


David Sundstrom's HST model shows off the new grappling capabilities of Atlantis' manipulator arm.
The arm can be controlled via the control pad (Ctrl-Space).
